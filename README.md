This is an exercise to gauge real-world problem solving using PHP, Laravel, and Vue.js

## Getting Started

To get started, download this repository AS A ZIP. Then get your development environment setup. 

A couple of links to help get you started:

## The Challenge

1. Get your development environment setup.
2. Seed data from this laravel project into the correct database/table.
3. Create API Controller to GET items from the seeded articles table in the laravel mysql database.
4. Call the created API controller from ExampleComponent.vue and render it in that component.
